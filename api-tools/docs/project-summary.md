# Completed Changes for API Tools MCP Server

## Overview of Completed Tasks

1. Successfully rebranded the project from "PDF Tools" to "API Tools"
2. Added new API integration functionality alongside existing PDF tools
3. Implemented authentication methods for API calls
4. Added OpenAPI specification exploration capabilities
5. Created tools for generating API call templates
6. Updated documentation to reflect new features
7. Added tests for API functionality

## Implemented API Tools

1. **call_api**: Makes authenticated API calls to a specified endpoint
   - Supports multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Includes support for authentication (Bearer token, Basic auth)
   - Handles query parameters, headers, and request bodies

2. **get_api_operations**: Parses OpenAPI specifications
   - Retrieves available operations from an API
   - Can filter operations by operation ID
   - Supports local and remote API specifications

3. **generate_api_call**: Creates templates for API calls
   - Uses OpenAPI specifications to build accurate request templates
   - Populates parameters, headers, and request bodies
   - Handles complex schema definitions

## Authentication Methods

- **Bearer token authentication**: For token-based APIs (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- **Basic authentication**: For username/password authentication
- **No authentication**: For public APIs

## Testing and Verification

- Created test script for API call functionality
- Verified API calls to public endpoints
- Tested authentication methods

## Documentation

- Updated README.md with new API tools information
- Created detailed API integration documentation
- Added example usage for common API scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Authentication Methods**:
   - OAuth 2.0 flow support
   - API key authentication
   - Custom authentication schemes

2. **Extended API Tools**:
   - WebSocket support
   - GraphQL integration
   - API testing and validation

3. **Integration with Identity Services**:
   - Azure AD integration
   - Microsoft Identity Platform support
   - Managed identities for cloud deployments
